# recursiveDice

This is based on a game demo I saw a while ago. 
I thought no one would spend time playing a game like this against someone else, so I made the computer play against itself using a recursive function.

# Rules:
The first player to reach a score of >= 100 will win.
If the dice rolls an odd number, then it's the next player's turn.
